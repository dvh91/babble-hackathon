Nothing! What's a motto with you? Ahh ha ha ha...
You know, kid-- These two words will solve all your problems.
That's right! Take Pumbaa for example.


Why, when he was a young warthog...
When I was a young wart hoooog!
Very nice.
Thanks!
 He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal
He could clear the savannah after every meal
	I'm a sensitive soul, though I seem thick-skinned
And it hurt that my friends never stood downwind
And oh, the shame
He was ashamed!
Thoughta changin' my name

And I got downhearted

Ev'rytime that I...
Pumbaa! Not in front of the kids!

Hakuna Matata!

Welcome... to our humble home.
You live here?
We live wherever we want.
	Yep. Home is where your rump rests. Heh!
It's beautiful.
 I'm starved.
 Eeeahhah. We're fresh out of zebra.
Any antelope?
Na ah.
 Hippo?
Nope. Listen, kid; if you live with us, you have to eat like us. Hey, this looks like a good spot to rustle up some grub.


Eeew. What's that?
A grub. What's it look like?
Eeew. Gross.
 Mmmm. Tastes like chicken.
 
 Slimy, yet satisfying.
These are rare delicacies. Mmmm.  Piquant, with a very pleasant crunch.
You'll learn to love 'em.
I'm telling you, kid, this is the great life. No rules. No responsibilities. Oooh! The little cream-filled kind. And best of all, no worries.

	Well, kid?
Oh well-- Hakuna Matata.

 Slimy, yet satisfying.
